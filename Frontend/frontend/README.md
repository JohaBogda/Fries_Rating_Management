Fries Rating Management Tool
I love fries. And I have a bad memory. So this list is a way to keep track of the fries everywhere, and rate them based on how good they taste, note what type of fries they were, etc.

Approach
followed step by step of this youtube video that implements Springboot, Java, Bootstrap, using VS Code for React: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n43h1eJ2EUE&list=PLGRDMO4rOGcNLnW1L2vgsExTBg-VPoZHr

made sure SQL was up and running, saving everything to the database

created a wire frame (handdrawn)

worked with class components

imported router for a more user friendly experience

found an API to render

mixed bootstrap and basic CSS

Future Notes
Things I'd like to achieve in the future:

fully render the API in either drop down or search bar
add a login page for practice
have the background picture cover full page/ scrolldown
implement rating system (5 stars)
have error message so input is clear (rating between 1 and 5)
