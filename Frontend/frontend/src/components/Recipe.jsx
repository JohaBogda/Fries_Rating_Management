                <p>Translated from recipes on the websites frietmuseum.be and gastronomie-wallone.be; serves 4-6.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>3-4 cups vegetable oil or, if you can find it, white beef tallow
                    2 pounds Yukon Gold or similar potatoes, cleaned, dried and peeled
                    Salt to taste</p>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>Cut or julienne the potatoes into sticks 1/2-inch wide and up to 3 inches long. Dry all the pieces thoroughly with paper toweling. (Gently “roll” them underhand, using a couple layers of paper toweling. At no point rinse them.) Separate or pile them into batches about 1 cup each in volume.
                <br></br>  <br></br> Use a pot of a size that the melted fat or oil reaches halfway up the sides but no more than 3/4 of the way up. Heat the fat or oil to 300 degrees.
                    Deep-fry the potatoes for 6 minutes per batch. (They should be lightly colored but not browned.) With a slotted spoon or “spider,” remove them to a flattened brown paper bag or 2 thicknesses of paper toweling, either set onto a baking sheet. Before doing the next batch, be sure to bring back the temperature of the oil in the pot to 300 degrees.
                    <br></br>  When finished with the batches, let the potatoes rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to a few hours.
                    <br></br> Reheat the oil to a temperature of 375 degrees. (Note the 75-degree difference from the first frying.) Fry the potatoes, as before in 1-cup batches, until they are just browned and crisp, 1-2 minutes. Drain on fresh brown paper bags or paper towels and place in a warmed serving bowl lined with more paper towels. Sprinkle with salt to taste and serve with mayonnaise.
